        <p>This map shows the displacement of homeless encampments in Denver by sweeps over a period of seven months. The time lapse shows how these sweeps push people around from place to place. Click on each month to see camps that were present that month. Click on camps to see details about that camp.</p>
        <p>These sweeps are cruel and inhumane, and violate <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/homeless-shelters/unsheltered-homelessness.html">CDC guidelines</a> that say that particularly during the pandemic, sweeps are dangerous not only to homeless individuals but the community as a whole. Sweeps accomplish nothing except harm for these people, frequently leading to people losing all of their belongings including vital survival gear.</p>
